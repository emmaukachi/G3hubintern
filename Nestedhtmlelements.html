<body>
    <p>HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).

        All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.
        
        The following example contains four HTML elements (html, body, h1 and p)</p>
    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>

    <p>The <html> element is the root element and it defines the whole HTML document.

        It has a start tag <html> and an end tag </html>.
        
        Then, inside the (html) element there is a (body) element</p>
    <p>The <body> element defines the document's body.

        It has a start tag <body> and an end tag </body>.
        
        Then, inside the (body) element there is two other elements: <h1> and p tag</p>        
    <p>The <h1> element defines a heading.

        It has a start tag <h1> and an end tag </h1></p>
    <p>The <p> element defines a paragraph.

        It has a start tag <p> and an end tag </p></p>
</body>
